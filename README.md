# Ideas-Worth-Building
- Zoom Idler: give me a tool to be able to automatically join a zoom call and idle on it so that I can be counted for attendance (the bot would then leave the call at the end of the meeting)
- Housing Scraper: give me a list of available properties to contact in an area using Craigslist, FB Marketplace, etc...
- Anki (flashcards) with images
- VAE Synthesizer
- Poker bot

# Stream of Consciousness
- Some sort of community-based life-coaching without needing certified therapists to help people (especially in small businesses or schools where it might be hard to get a service like this) emotional support when they need it (etc)
- 2E Music Box Classifier, but it actually works
- Poker Mod Creator
- Perciever Architecture for Image Scanning
- Senior week (MIT) Event Matcher (generally, constraint solvers for people to be able to coordinate large events when people have different preferences)
- Mutability scopes: change whether something is mutable or not and guarantee that this property is held in a scope: this is useful to give you the best of both worlds.
- DSL for Machine Learning Computation graphs and automatic creation and searches of architecture spaces, etcetera...
- Meal Swipe Sharing Platform (and meeting new people over a brunch, lunch, or dinner at MIT)
- Use Machine Learning to extract the matching algorithms from Tinder, Hinge, etcetera...
- Social CRM: search for people your friends know, etcetera...
- Calendly, but prioritized, and generally good
- Machine learning for math using multiple representations when there is less data (decoupling syntax from semantics)
- ML for Crypto Challenges (CTF competitions, mainly)
- ML to solve Leetcode
- ML to generate Leetcode problems with solutions
- Fully functioning neural network in Minecraft
- Card against X where X is your school or organization
- Evolutionary Algorithm of ML Algorithms based on papers' algorithms' success over time and maybe some other "fitness" criterion
- Factory as a service
- PlugShare, but actually more common
- Psychadelic treatments for depression startup
- ML Weight Independence Loss
- Analog Neural Network (or at least MMult)
- GNN for geopolitical strengths and weaknesses
- Pytorch to FPGA compiler
- CRM to distribute media across different outlets seamlessly
- CSGO Playing Bot
- Edyfi, but it actually keeps existing
- Crypto options in crypto
- Crypto Credit
- Documentary of the US made by traveling around and compiling interviews (much like Borat, but actually not trolling)
- Pokemon Go, except the person is the Pokemon (perhaps a dating app)
- Dating app where people create X and then like or dislike others' X's (where X is a poem, a picture, a meme, ... a something of your choosing)
- App to meet people at an airport like Groupon
- P2P Wifi-like network without Wifi
- Market research as a service
- "Record Email" button
- Zapier for DAOs
- ML Iterative Layer Training + Adding On
- Distillation to enable one-to-one stitching
- ML to create legible parsers (parser generator)
- Absurd Advertisements class
- Picture (or similar) to TeX
- Automated dating app responses and profile generation
- Proof of time for decentralized time
- 1/N runtime parallel training using sim-loss for ultra-fast distillation
- Neural Network to decision tree interpretbility algorithm
- PNG to Ascii Art and vice versa
- Contrastive learning with random images (or maybe useful for energy models), also, at different levels of abstraction
